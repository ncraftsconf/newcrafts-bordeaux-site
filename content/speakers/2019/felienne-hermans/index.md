Felienne is associate professor at the [Leiden Institute of Advanced Computer Science](https://liacs.leidenuniv.nl/) at Leiden University, where she heads the PERL research group, focused on programming education.

On Saturdays she teaches children programming in a local community centre. She is one of the organizers of the [CurryOn](https://www.curry-on.org) conference, which aims to bridge the gap between industry and academia. Felienne was also one of the founders of the [Joy of Coding](https://joyofcoding.org/) conference, with a similar goal, which she organized for 6 years. Since 2016, she has been a host at [SE radio](https://www.se-radio.net/), one of the most popular software engineering podcasts on the web. When she is not coding, blogging or teaching, she is probably knitting, running or playing a (board)game.

* [Scientific council](https://www.mediawijzer.net/van-mediawijzer-net/wetenschappelijkeraad/) of [Netwerk mediawijzer](https://www.mediawijzer.net/)
