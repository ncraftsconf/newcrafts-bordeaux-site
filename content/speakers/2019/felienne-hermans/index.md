Felienne is assistant professor at Delft University of Technology, where she makes programming for non-programmers more awesome. She built an IDE for spreadsheets in the form of smell detection, refactoring and unit testing tools for Excel, and has researched code smells and clone detection in the Scratch programming language for kids.

She is also one of the founders of Joy of Coding, a one day developer conference in Rotterdam, celebrating the love for programming.

When not building programs that play board games or card games, she is probably dancing Lindy Hop or killing creeps in a tower defense game.
