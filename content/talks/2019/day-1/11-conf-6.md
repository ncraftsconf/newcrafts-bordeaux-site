Category Theory might be really intimidating. So much complex words used by very smart people, how can we pretend to understand this? Do we need to understand it? In a nutshell, Category Theory is the most abstract branch of mathematic. So abstract that you use it already, without knowing it, in different implementations. You also have the basic knowledge to understand more concrete examples. 

The goal of this talk is to show that, once you have the correct vocabulary, Category Theory is not that hard. I’d like to demonstrate that it is always useful to understand the mathematics roots of this theory, especially if you’re interested in Functional Programming, but also to find your own useful implementation. It is a young discipline, like IT, where most things can still be discovered!
