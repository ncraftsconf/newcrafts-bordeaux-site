Most introductory material on music focuses on melody, rhythm and harmony, in the tradition of written classical music. Yet, there's much more than that in music! Playing and creating instruments, sound synthesis, psycho-acoustic perception and illusions, how all this is shaping musical genres, interactions of musicians or DJ with the audience, MIDI production techniques... these all sound like Bounded Contexts to the DDD practitioner. Through this session we'll model parts of the rich domain of music with Java and Arduino, in what's really an application of DDD. With some home-made cheesy video, you'll discover and understand music in a new light, and you'll feel like doing your own experiments back at home!
