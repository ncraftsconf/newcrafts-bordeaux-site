                <h3>Programming as a Way of Thinking</h3>
                <p class="text-alt">A conference that doesn’t affect the way you think about programming, is not
                    worth
                    attending!

                    Created by developers for developers, NewCrafts is an independent and international event on
                    software
                    development held annually in Paris since 2014.
                    <br /> Because we believe it is not enough for code to work, we want to challenge not only the
                    way you
                    develop but also how you perceive the profession and your craft.
